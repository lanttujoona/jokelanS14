#Joke-LAN S14 theme - based on BST - A Bootstrap 3 Starter Theme, for WordPress

## Idea: http://stanislav.it

**BST is a (very) simple WordPress starter theme loaded with Bootstrap 3.**

*Version 1.5*


##Features

* *Simple, intuitive, clean code.*
* CSS, JS, functions and template parts in different folders.
* **Bootstrap 3.2.0** - CSS and JS enqueued. You can simply swap the default Bootstrap 3 files (included) for a custom made Bootstrap 3, and this theme will still work.
* **jQuery 1.11.1** called from Google CDN, with a local fallback when offline.
* **NEW: WooCommerce** plugin support.
* **NEW:** Choice of two navbar positions (top of screen and/or below site title). Simply delete what you don't need.
* A starter CSS theme - `bst.css`, enqueued.
* Visual editor stylesheet - into which the same Bootsrap 3 and starter CSS theme are preloaded by `@import`, so that **WYSI(M!)WYG** - what you see in the visual editor is (mostly!) what you get at the front end.
* `Modernizr.js`, `respond.js` and `html5shiv.css` included - enqueued.
* Clean-up scripts in place - for helping web design newbies find their way around the HTML outputted by WordPress. (Do not rely on these for security.)
* A few simple jQuery scripts - in `bst.js`, enqueued. Example: **Hovernav** (see below).
* Custom comment list callback.
* Easily make this theme your own - if you rename `bst.css` to `yourtheme.css`, and `bst.js` to `yourtheme.js`, and then do a global search-and-replace to rename "bst" to "yourtheme" everywhere in the theme's code, this theme will still work. (You must also modify the comments in `style.css`, and rename the root folder from **bst/** to **yourtheme/**.)
* [MIT licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) (open source).

This theme has been built for use as a starter theme and as a learning aid for people who wish to get into WordPress theme design.

###Hovernav

The navbar has some modifications that make the dropdown menu appear on hover (in `bst.js` plus `bst.css`). *The Bootstrap js and css have not been changed*. You can easily delete the "hovernav" segments of bst.js and bst.css if you don't want them.
